<h3 class="Chapters">CSS Specificity</h3>
<p>If there are two or more conflicting CSS rules that point to the same
  element, the browser follows some rules to determine which one is most
  specific and therefore wins out. Think of specificity as a score/rank that
  determines which style declarations are ultimately applied to an element.
  The universal selector (*) has low specificity, while ID selectors are
  highly specific!</p>

<div class="note"><b>Note:</b> Specificity is a common reason why your
  CSS-rules don't apply to some elements, although you think they should.
</div>

<p><b>Specificity Hierarchy</b></p>
<p>Every selector has its place in the specificity hierarchy. There are four
  categories which define the specificity level of a selector:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Inline styles</b> - An inline style is attached directly to the
    element to be styled. Example: &lth1 style="color: #ffffff;"&gt.</li>
  <li><b>IDs</b> - An ID is a unique identifier for the page elements, such as
    #navbar.</li>
  <li><b>Classes, attributes and pseudo-classes</b> - This category includes
    .classes, [attributes] and pseudo-classes such as :hover, :focus etc.</li>
  <li><b>Elements and pseudo-elements</b> - This category includes element
    names and pseudo-elements, such as h1, div, :before and :after.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>How to Calculate Specificity?</b></p>
<p>Memorize how to calculate specificity! Start at 0, add 1000 for style
  attribute, add 100 for each ID, add 10 for each attribute, class or
  pseudo-class, add 1 for each element name or pseudo-element. Consider these
  three code fragments:</p>

<div class="example">
  A: h1<br>
  B: #content h1<br>
  C: &ltdiv id="content"&gt&lth1 style="color: #ffffff"&gtHeading&lt/h1&gt</div>
</div>

<p>The specificity of A is 1 (one element)<br>
The specificity of B is 101 (one ID reference and one element)<br>
The specificity of C is 1000 (inline styling)</p>
<p>Since 1 < 101 < 1000, the third rule (C) has a greater level of specificity
  and therefore will be applied.</p>

<p><b>Specificity Rules</b></p>
<p><b>Equal specificity: the latest rule counts</b> - If the same rule is
  written twice into the external style sheet, then the lower rule in the
  style sheet is closer to the element to be styled, and therefore will be
  applied:</p>
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>the latter rule is always applied.</p>
<p><b>ID selectors have a higher specificity than attribute selectors</b> -
  Look at the following three code lines:</p>

<div id="a">This is a div</div>

<p>the first rule is more specific than the other two, and will be applied.</p>
<p><b>Contextual selectors are more specific than a single element
  selector</b> - The embedded style sheet is closer to the element to be
  styled. So in the following situation</p>
  <p>From external CSS file:<br>
  #content h1 {background-color: red;}<br>

  In HTML file:<br>
  &ltstyle&gt<br>
  #content h1 {<br>
      background-color: yellow;<br>
  }<br>
  &lt/style&gt</p>
<p>the latter rule will be applied.</p>
<p><b>A class selector beats any number of element selectors</b> - a class
  selector such as .intro beats h1, p, div, etc:</p>
  <h1 class="intro">This is a heading</h1>
<p><b>The universal selector and inherited values have a specificity of 0</b>
  - *, body * and similar have a zero specificity. Inherited values also have
  a specificity of 0.</p>
