<h1 class="chapters">JavaScript Object Properties</h1>
<p>Properties are the most important part of any JavaScript object.</p>

<h2>JavaScript Properties</h2>
<p>Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object. A 
    JavaScript object is a collection of unordered properties. Properties can 
    usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only.</p>

<h2>Accessing JavaScript Properties</h2>
<p>The syntax for accessing the property of an object is:</p>

<div class="bb"><em>objectName.property</em> // person.age</div>

<p>or</p>

<div class="bb"><em>objectName["property"]</em> // person["age"]</div>

<p>or</p>

<div class="bb"><em>objectName[expression]</em> // x = "age"; person[x]</div>

<div class="note">The expression must evaluate to a property name.</div>
<p>There are two different ways to access an object property: you can use 
    .property or ["property"].</p>
<p id="demo1"></p>

<script>
    var person = {
        firstname: "John",
        lastname: "Doe",
        age: 50,
        eyecolor: "blue"
    };
    document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML =
        person.firstname + " is " + person.age + " years old.";
</script>

<p id="demo2"></p>

<script>
    var person = {
        firstname: "John",
        lastname: "Doe",
        age: 50,
        eyecolor: "blue"
    };
    document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML =
        person["firstname"] + " is " + person["age"] + " years old.";
</script>

<h2>JavaScript for...in Loop</h2>
<p>The JavaScript for...in statement loops through the properties of an 
    object. Syntax:</p>

<div class="bb">
for (variable in object) {<br>
    <em>code to be executed</em><br>
}
</div>

<p>The block of code inside of the for...in loop will be executed once for 
    each property. Looping through the properties of an object:</p>
<p id="demo3"></p>

<script>
    var txt = "";
    var person = { fname: "John", lname: "Doe", age: 25 };
    var x;
    for (x in person) {
        txt += person[x] + " ";
    }
    document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = txt;
</script>

<h2>Adding New Properties</h2>
<p>You can add new properties to an existing object by simply giving it a 
    value. Assume that the person object already exists - you can then give 
    it new properties:</p>
<p id="demo4"></p>

<script>
    var person = {
        firstname: "John",
        lastname: "Doe",
        age: 50,
        eyecolor: "blue"
    };
    person.nationality = "English";
    document.getElementById("demo4").innerHTML =
        person.firstname + " is " + person.nationality + ".";
</script>

<div class="note">You cannot use reserved words for property (or method) 
    names. JavaScript naming rules apply.</div>

<h2>Deleting Properties</h2>
<p>The <b>delete</b> keyword deletes a property from an object:</p>
<p id="demo5"></p>

<script>
    var person = {
        firstname: "John",
        lastname: "Doe",
        age: 50,
        eyecolor: "blue"
    };
    delete person.age;
    document.getElementById("demo5").innerHTML =
        person.firstname + " is " + person.age + " years old.";
</script>

<p>The delete keyword deletes both the value of the property and the property 
    itself. After deletion, the property cannot be used before it is added 
    back again. The delete operator is designed to be used on object 
    properties. It has no effect on variables or functions. The delete 
    operator should not be used on predefined JavaScript object properties. 
    It can crash your application.</p>

<h2>Property Attributes</h2>
<p>All properties have a name. In addition they also have a value. The value 
    is one of the property's attributes. Other attributes are: enumerable, 
    configurable, and writable. These attributes define how the property can 
    be accessed (is it readable?, is it writable?) In JavaScript, all 
    attributes can be read, but only the value attribute can be changed (and 
    only if the property is writable). ( ECMAScript 5 has methods for both 
    getting and setting all property attributes)</p>

<h2>Prototype Properties</h2>
<p>JavaScript objects inherit the properties of their prototype. The delete 
    keyword does not delete inherited properties, but if you delete a 
    prototype property, it will affect all objects inherited from the 
    prototype.</p>
