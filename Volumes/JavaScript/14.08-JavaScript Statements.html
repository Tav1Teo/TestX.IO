<h1 class="Chapters">JavaScript Statements</h1>
<p>A <b>JavaScript program</b> is a list of <b>statements</b> to be executed 
    by a computer.</p>
<p id="demo1"></p>

<script>

    var x, y, z;  // Statement 1
    x = 5;        // Statement 2
    y = 6;        // Statement 3
    z = x + y;    // Statement 4

    document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML =
        "The value of z is " + z + ".";

</script>

<h2>JavaScript Programs</h2>
<p>A <b>computer program</b> is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by 
    a computer. In a programming language, these programming instructions are
called <b>statements</b>. A <b>JavaScript program</b> is a list of programming 
<b>statements</b>.</p>

<div class="note">In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web 
    browser.</div>

<h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>
<p>JavaScript statements are composed of: Values, Operators, Expressions, 
    Keywords and Comments. This statement tells the browser to write "Hello 
    Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo2":</p>
<p>In HTML, JavaScript statements are executed by the browser.</p>
<p id="demo2"></p>

<script>
    document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly.";
</script>

<p>Most JavaScript programs contain many JavaScript statements. The 
    statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are 
    written.</p>

<div class="note">JavaScript programs (and JavaScript statements) are often 
    called JavaScript code.</div>

<h2>Semicolons ;</h2>
<p>Semicolons separate JavaScript statements. Add a semicolon at the end of 
    each executable statement:</p>
<p id="demo3"></p>

<script>
    var a, b, c;
    a = 1;
    b = 2;
    c = a + b;
    document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = c;
</script>

<p>When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are 
    allowed:</p>
<p id="demo4"></p>

<script>
    var a, b, c;
    a = 1; b = 2; c = a + b;
    document.getElementById("demo4").innerHTML = c;
</script>

<div class="note">On the web, you might see examples without semicolons. 
    Ending statements with semicolon is not required, but highly 
    recommended.</div>

<h2>JavaScript White Space</h2>
<p>JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script 
    to make it more readable. The following lines are equivalent:</p>
<p>var person = "Hege"; <br> var person="Hege";</p>
<p>A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ):</p>
<p>var x = y + z;</p>

<h2>JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks</h2>
<p>For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer 
    than 80 characters. If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, 
    the best place to break it, is after an operator:</p>
<p>The best place to break a code line is after an operator or a comma.</p>
<p id="demo5"></p>

<script>
    document.getElementById("demo5").innerHTML =
        "Hello Dolly!";
</script>

<h2>JavaScript Code Blocks</h2>
<p>JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly 
    brackets {...}. The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be 
    executed together. One place you will find statements grouped together in 
    blocks, is in JavaScript functions:</p>
<p>JavaScript code blocks are written between { and }</p>

<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Click Me!</button>

<p id="demo6"></p>
<p id="demo7"></p>

<script>
    function myFunction() {
        document.getElementById("demo6").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly!";
        document.getElementById("demo7").innerHTML = "How are you?";
    }
</script>

<div class="note">In this tutorial we use 4 spaces of indentation for code 
    blocks. You will learn more about functions later in this tutorial.</div>

<h2>JavaScript Keywords</h2>
<p>JavaScript statements often start with a <b>keyword</b> to identify the 
    JavaScript action to be performed. Here is a list of some of the keywords 
    you will learn about in this tutorial:</p>
<table class="properties">
    <tr>
        <th>Keyword</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>break</td>
        <td>Terminates a switch or a loop</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>continue</td>
        <td>Jumps out of a loop and starts at the top</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>debugger</td>
        <td>Stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the 
            debugging function</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>do ... while</td>
        <td>Executes a block of statements, and repeats the block, while a 
            condition is true</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>for</td>
        <td>Marks a block of statements to be executed, as long as a 
            condition is true</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>function</td>
        <td>Declares a function</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>if ... else</td>
        <td>Marks a block of statements to be executed, depending on a 
            condition</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>return</td>
        <td>Exits a function</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>switch</td>
        <td>Marks a block of statements to be executed, depending on 
            different cases</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>try ... catch</td>
        <td>Implements error handling to a block of statements</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>var</td>
        <td>Declares a variable</td>
    </tr>
</table>
