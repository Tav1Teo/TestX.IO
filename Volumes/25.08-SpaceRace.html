    <h1>Space Race</h1>
    <h2>The Space Race was an informal competition between the United States 
        and the Soviet Union to see who could make the furthest advancements 
        into space first. It involved the efforts to explore outer space with 
        artificial satellites, to send man into space, and to land him on the 
        Moon.</h2>

        <h2>Russia Launches Sputnik</h2>
        <p>On July 29, 1957, in recognition of the 1957-1958 International 
            Geophysical Year, the White House announced that the U.S. 
            intended to launch satellites by the spring of 1958. This became 
            known as Project Vanguard. On July 31, the Soviets announced
            that they intended to launch a satellite by the fall of 1957.</p>
        <p>Sputnik is regarded as the beginning of the Space Race.</p>

        <h2>The Explorer 1</h2>
        <p>Explorer 1 (international designation 1958 Alpha 1) was the first 
            Earth satellite of the United States, launched on February 1, 
            1958 at 03:48 UTC from LC-26 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station 
            as part of the United States program for the International
            Geophysical Year and in response to the launch of the Soviet 
            satellite Sputnik 1. It was the first spacecraft to recognize the 
            Van Allen radiation belt, although Sputnik 2 detected it 
            earlier.</p>

        <h2>Lunokhod 1</h2>
        <p>Lunokhod 1 (Луноход, moon walker in Russian) was the first of two 
            unmanned lunar rovers landed on the Moon by the Soviet Union as 
            part of its Lunokhod program. The spacecraft which carried 
            Lunokhod 1 was named Luna 17. Lunokhod was the first roving 
            remote-controlled robot to land on another celestial body.</p>
        <p>Luna 17 was launched on November 10, 1970 at 14:44:01 UTC. After 
            reaching earth parking orbit, the final stage of Luna 17's
            launching rocket fired to place it into a trajectory towards the 
            Moon (1970-11-10 at 14:54 UTC). After two course correction
            maneuvers (on November 12 and 14), it entered lunar orbit on 
            November 15, 1970 at 22:00 UTC.</p>

        <h2>End of the Space Race</h2>
        <p>The 17 July 1975 rendezvous of the Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft 
            traditionally marks the end of the Space Race</p>
        <p>While the Sputnik 1 launch can clearly be called the start of the 
            Space Race, its end is more debatable. Most hotly contested during 
            the 1960s, the Space Race continued apace through the U.S. Apollo 
            moon landing of 1969. Although they followed Apollo 11 with five 
            more manned lunar landings, American space scientists turned to 
            new arenas. Skylab was to gather data, and the Space Shuttle was 
            intended to return spaceships intact from space journeys.</p>
